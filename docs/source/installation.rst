Installation
---------------

Install the latest stable release from PyPI using::

    pip install pyholoscope 

Using pip install should find and install all the dependencies. 

Note that the pip install doesn't include the examples and tests which still 
need to be `downloaded from Github <http://www.github.com/MikeHughesKent/pyholoscope>`_.

If manually downloading the source from Github, rather than from PyPI, you will need to 
either manually check you have the requirements 
installed, or navigate to the pyholoscope folder on your machine and run::

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
to install the dependencies. You may wish to create a virtual environment 
using Conda/venv first to avoid conflicts with your existing python setup.
